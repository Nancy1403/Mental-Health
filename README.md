# Mental-Health

Mental health issues have become a significant concern globally, affecting individuals across all age groups, cultures, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Despite growing awareness, many people continue to suffer in silence due to stigma, lack of access to mental health services, inadequate mental health education, and insufficient support systems. Depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and other mental health conditions are leading causes of disability, reduced productivity, and diminished quality of life.

In many regions, especially in low- and middle-income countries, mental health resources are scarce, and mental health is often not prioritized within the healthcare system. Furthermore, early signs of mental distress frequently go unnoticed or are misunderstood, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment
